Trying to create and efficient bot to do some analysis of tweets

creds has my consumer_key, consumer_secret, access_token, access_token_secret

Creating scraper to stream live tweets, since during my previous twitter sentimental analysis project the scraper was created and given to us in the course CS 6350 class.

Since I had changed my laptop and the code was creating some errors so rather than just solving the error I preferred creating a similar streamer.

I am planning on using some plotting libraries of python to plot the tweets on the world map based on the sentiment and the location.

Let's see how far I get ahead with this.

Feel free to ask me questions about the code.

Thanks :D
